            <p>Our company fiirst established after seven of friends had just obtained their bachelor degree
                of Informatics Engineering from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. The three had then decided to
                start a small game developing company and starts to create their first game called "PeeboJump".
            </p> 
            <p>Two months later after our studio had published our first game "PeeboJump", the game went up as a great 
                success for more than 15000 purchase on Steam.   
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, we decided to develop a new game called "Maestro of Time" and recruited more than 20 people 
                into our studio. The game was also a success for more than 1200 purchase within the first month of its release.
            </p>
            <p>Five months later, we decided to start developing a new game called "Bingqilin". The game then received a Steam
                Award Nomination for "One of The Best 2D Platformer Game of The Year".
